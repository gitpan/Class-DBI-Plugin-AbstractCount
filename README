SYNOPSIS

  use base 'Class::DBI';
  use Class::DBI::Plugin::AbstractCount;

  my $count = Music::Vinyl->count_search_where(
    { artist   => 'Frank Zappa'
    , title    => { like    => '%Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar%' }
    , released => { between => [ 1980, 1982 ] }
    });

DESCRIPTION

This Class::DBI plugin combines the functionality from
Class::DBI::Plugin::CountSearch (counting objects without having to use an
array or an iterator), and Class::DBI::AbstractSearch, which allows complex
where-clauses a la SQL::Abstract.

METHODS

  count_search_where

  Takes a hashref with the abstract where-clause. An additional attribute
  hashref can be passed to influence the default behaviour: arrayrefs are
  OR'ed, hashrefs are AND'ed.

TODO

More tests, more doc.

SEE ALSO

  SQL::Abstract for details about the where-clause and the attributes.
